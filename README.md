## Acknowledgements

This plugin acquires data from http://gdam.org. Without their dedicated work, this plugin would not
be possible. Please use their service humbly and only download the data you need. Also see their data policy:

> The data are freely available for academic use and other non-commercial use. Redistribution, or

To quote from their [About page](https://gadm.org/about.html):

> GADM wants to map the administrative areas of all countries, at all levels of sub-division. We use
  a high spatial resolution, and of a extensive set of attributes. This is a never ending project,
  but we are happy to share what we have.
