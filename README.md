# GADM Loader

GADM loader is a QGIS plugin that allows you to download GADM data and add them directly to your QGIS project.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin acquires data from http://gdam.org. Without their dedicated work, this plugin would not
be possible. To quote from their [About page](https://gadm.org/about.html).

> GADM wants to map the administrative areas of all countries, at all levels of sub-division. We use
  a high spatial resolution, and of a extensive set of attributes. This is a never ending project,
  but we are happy to share what we have.
